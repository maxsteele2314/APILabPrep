      Project 2 Prep
     </h1>
     
     <p> We will be creating an App in which we can display a given Pokemon's abilities, height, moves, spieces and more. </p>
     
     <h2>
         What API are we Using?
     </h2>
     
     <p> https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/ </p>
     
     <h2>
         Sketch of our Design
     </h2>
     
     <p> When our App is initially accessed it will present a banner with "Pokemon" displayed as long as the data set is present. Below the banner will be a navigator in which our 20 pokemons can be sorted through with mutiple attributes such as species, height, ability etc. Below our list we will have a div that is filled with the selected pokemons entire list of facts and with its image to the right of the information. We will add CSS to give the App a pleasing appeal to th eye while also being completly fuctionable.  </p>
     
     <h2>
         Unsure how to accomplish?
     </h2>
     
     <p>
         Below is a list of things we are struggling to accomplish:
     </p>
     <ol>
         <li> For some reason we can't get our "p" tags to appear after we have created poke-info variable and called it in our original var promise. (solved) </li>
         <li> The range is cut off at 20 and when we try to display the abilities of the the first 20 pokemons they arent neccessarily inside of the first 20 abilities so we have expand the range of at least one of our things. (Solved but new problem found when solved)  </li>
         <li> The new problem that arose was that without the range their are a thoussand pokemons and around three hundred abilities so that is difficult to sort through. </li>
     </ol>
